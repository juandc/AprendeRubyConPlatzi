# Platzi Ruby Simple Basics

Take the course :wink:: https://platzi.com/cursos/ruby/.

Notes:

- **History**, Ruby creator is [Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukihiro_Matsumoto) :older_man:
- Variables do not need any word like `var` or `const` for been declared, `var = "something"` is enough :+1:
- Variable names convention is [Snake Case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) (example: `yes_is_admin` or `facilitator_roles_lowercase`) :low_brightness:
- As well as Python :snake::sweat_smile:, Ruby works without brackets or semicolons bit with tabs:

  ```ruby
  if bla_bla
    puts do_this
  else
    puts do_that
  end # I dont like this "end" :thinking:
  ```

- Yes, like the example above, conditionals do not need parentesis :straight_ruler:
